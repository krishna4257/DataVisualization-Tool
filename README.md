# DataVisualization-Tool

Objective :- This Data Visualization tool will take .CSV or .XSLX type of data files and present the data to user according to user wish.

IDE used :- pycharm (src ==> https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

Libraries used :- Pandas, Matplotlib

Description :- 

     - The user will enter the data from different sources such as(word file, c.s.v file, SQL file, etc). our project should detect the type of file and it should open the file accordingly.

     - After opening, the project should arrange the data in a proper format (we can do this using pandas Data Frame in python) and it should ask the user to enter the missing data in a particular row or it will consider as zero if the user gave the access.

     - After that, we should give the output as different sources such as proper table format, graphs, averages, and some other better ways depending on our discussion.

     - User will get options on which data to be visualised and which way to be visualised.
